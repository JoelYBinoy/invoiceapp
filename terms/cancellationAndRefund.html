                    This Cancellation and Refund Policy shall apply to any cancellation of subscription of the joinbills Products and applicable refunds. joinbills shall not entertain any refund requests if cancellation of subscription is in violation of this policy or its Terms of Service or if joinbills terminates the User account for violation of its Terms of Service. 
This Cancellation and Refund Policy is a part of and is to be read along with the “Terms of Service”. Capitalized terms used in this policy but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Service. 
A User may cancel their subscription at any time if they are not satisfied with the product or service. However, joinbills will be liable to refund the subscription consideration only during the “Refund Period”, as mentioned below:  (a) where the initial purchase of the subscription has been assisted by an authorised joinbills sales agent, within 7 days from the Account Setup appointment; or  (b) where the initial purchase of the subscription is made either directly by the User or through any sales channel other than as mentioned in (a) above, within 7 days from the date of purchase of the subscription (as mentioned on the invoice). 
For the avoidance of doubt: 
1. A User can only avail refund once and for an amount no more than the total subscription consideration paid to joinbills; 
2. Refunds are not applicable for subscription renewals; 
3. Refunds are not applicable on purchase of upgrades by a User during the subscription term, unless the upgrade is purchased during the Refund Period; 
All requests for cancellation of subscription and refund should be raised only via the customer support helpline provided by joinbills. Cancellation and refund requests raised through any other mode of communication will not be considered for refund. 
joinbills has arrangements with banks, affiliates, payment gateways, payment aggregators and other financial service providers for processing refunds (“Service Providers”). joinbills endeavors to ensure that eligible refunds are processed within 20 working days of your request for cancellation of subscription. However, this timeline is indicative and processing of refunds is subject to the time taken by the Service Providers. The User shall provide such information as may be required to facilitate refunds including but not limited to bank account details, bank branch details, UPI addresses, IFSC codes etc. joinbills is also entitled to deduct any fees, bank charges, or other expenses incurred by joinbills for processing the refund. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this policy, this Cancellation and Refund Policy shall not apply to the Users, who register and purchase subscription of joinbills Products (A) using the referral code/referral link of existing joinbills Users; or (B) by availing no-cost EMI payment solutions by third parties. Accordingly, such Users shall not be eligible for any refund from joinbills.
